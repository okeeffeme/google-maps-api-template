# Immortal Women

A short weekend project to document Oslo's tributes to women both historical and fictional.
Big thanks to [Jamie Shields](https://github.com/jayshields) for writing a handy guide over at [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/google-maps-javascript-api-the-right-way/). The starting point of this project comes from a fork of his repo Google Maps API template.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to clone this and poke around, I recommend spinning it up on [npm's http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
